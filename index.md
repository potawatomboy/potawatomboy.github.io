# THE TRAMP
Charlie Chaplin rose to  stardom by creating and playing a character called The Tramp. 
Marked by an unique outfit â€“ the bowler hat, a toothbrush mustache and baggy pants, he became an iconic figure revered by people all over the world.
Far from being the role model of a righteous citizen, The Tramp is an underdog, always short of money and a failure at regular jobs. 
Not the usual candidate for movie fame, but after the first world war, when political turmoil and mass unemployment became normal it was easy to get into the tragicomic adventures of the tramp who keeps his excellent manners even in skid row and adheres assiduously to his dreams of a better life.
